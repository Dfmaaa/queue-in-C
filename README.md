# queue-in-C
This queue uses a linked list. That means it can theoretically store infinite values. You can choose whether you want padding or packing.
Just uncomment the fourth line if you want packing. There's a detailed explanation above the SIZE_OVER_SPEED macro. If this code is faulty, please
make an issue. I'll then try to fix the bug(emphasis on try). I haven't tested the code yet because I will use this code for my graph later(BFS).
